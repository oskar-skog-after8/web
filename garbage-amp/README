This audio amplifier is made from electronic waste and a 3D printer.
It's associated speaker is made from a broken harddrive.

Notice that this amp uses a USB connector for the speaker.
Needless to say, bad things will happen if you think it's an actual USB device.
(It's the power pins that are used for connecting the speaker.)

There is also a dummy cable for directly connecting the speaker to a line
output.  NOTE: The speaker has too low impedance to do this, you might damage
the output!
